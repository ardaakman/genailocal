## ThirdEye: Store your entire working session as context
ThirdEye stores your entire UI history as context, giving instant access to your information. 

Users can get an LLM completion on any application, by starting a session with "#//" keys, writing a prompt, and triggering a completion with the `control` key.

ThirdEye is designed with privacy at heart, able to be modified to run only locally on device.
